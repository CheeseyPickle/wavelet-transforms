# Wavelet Transforms

Final project for a Fourier transforms class. Wrote code analyzing the wavelet transform, which is similar, but better for preserving sharp edges through filters and compression.

`main.py` allows you to take in input from your microphone and applies certain Fourier or wavelet filters to it (see `audioprocessors.py` for details).

`graphing.py` is for seeing the effects of wavelets & Fourier.

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get all the packages you need
